# React Travel App
This repo demonstrates how to build a travel app search page using React.

## Features
* Semantic HTML5 markup that supports screen readers and keyboard navigation
* WAI-ARIA compliant input fields, using [react-autosuggest](https://github.com/moroshko/react-autosuggest)
* Form autosuggest based on user input
* Form validation that checks for empty and identical origin/destination inputs
* The ability to save valid searches locally, allowing for automatic form re-populate after page refresh

*Note: The app does not return a list of results at this time; this functionality will be added at a later date*
